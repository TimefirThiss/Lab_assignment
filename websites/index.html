          <p>Music is my current passion. My mother sent me to a piano teacher for a couple months when I was young,
             but I didn't start practicing again until COVID hit. Since then it's been off-and-on to keep up 
             my studies whenever I have access to a piano. being tech literate has helped in aquiring sheet 
             music for practicing, but it wasn't until understanding some music theory and Jazz composision t
             hat things started to make sense for me to start playing my own music.</p>

          <p>One of the big influences of Jazz composition comes from Salsa music. 
            Growing up I listened to it on occasion, but it wasn't until recently that I 
            began to take interest in it's origins and composition. The video on the right does a 
            great job of explaning how different cultures and peoples slowly came together to make something 
            very special!</p>
